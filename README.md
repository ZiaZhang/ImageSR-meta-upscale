# ImageSR-meta-upscale
  **An experiment to modify the network `Meta-SR` which is proposed in CVPR2019.**<br>
    <br>
 `The modified network` differs from `Meta-SR` in the Meta-Upscale Module:<br>
  * The Meta-Upscale Module of our network additionally take the feature extracted by the Feature Learning Module as input.
  * The number of the hidden neurons increases from 256 to 512.
